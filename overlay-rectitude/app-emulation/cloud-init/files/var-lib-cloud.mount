# Cloud-init uses /var/lib/cloud as working directory, in which at least
# two directories are required to be executable. We intend not to persist
# cloud-init data across reboots. As a result, cloud-init will fetch metadata
# and run user's configuration again after reboot. This is important as /etc/init
# in lakitu is stateless.
